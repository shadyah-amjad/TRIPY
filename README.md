#### Application to display and book tourist trips to the occupied interior or inside the west bank and to organize the relationship between the tour coordinator and tourists . The importance of the application:This significance stems from the quantity and the number of tourists who visit the occupied interior or undertake tourist trips inside or outside the West, for example, the occupied interior visited 3 million Palestinians during the summer of 2018 and also encourages internal or external tourism, especially to Jerusalem, which would install the people of Jerusalem in their homes or commercial stores.To book a tourist, the app will opionally  accept different online payment options  methods like Jawwal pay or Bank.
